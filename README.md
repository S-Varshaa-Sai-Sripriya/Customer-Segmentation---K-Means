ðŸ“Š Dataset Explanation

### Customer Segmentation Dataset
The dataset contains demographic and purchasing behavior information of customers, often used for clustering and segmentation tasks in marketing.

- **Number of Instances**: ~200  
- **Number of Features**: 4 numerical + 1 identifier  
- **Target Variable**: None (unsupervised learning)

**Feature Details**:

- `CustomerID` â€“ Unique identifier for each customer.  
- `Gender` â€“ Gender of the customer (Male/Female).  
- `Age` â€“ Age of the customer.  
- `Annual Income (k$)` â€“ Annual income of the customer in thousand dollars.  
- `Spending Score (1-100)` â€“ Score assigned based on customer spending behavior.

This dataset is useful for:

- Unsupervised learning tasks like clustering.  
- Identifying distinct customer groups for targeted marketing.
